# Oncomouse's markdown.nvim plugin

This plugin combines a few features from other plugins while removing features I don't use:

1. The ability to do syntax-aware join (`J` and `gJ`) and newline (`o` and `O`).
1. All of the motion commands from [vim-markdown](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown).
